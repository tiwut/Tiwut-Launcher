        <h1>Privacy Policy for Tiwut App Store</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> November 17, 2025</p>

        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how the Tiwut App Store ("we," "us," or "our") application collects, uses, and handles your information when you use our software. Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to protecting it.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>The Tiwut App Store is designed to function with minimal collection of personal data. The information we handle can be categorized as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>User-Provided Information:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Library URLs:</strong> We collect and store the URLs of the application libraries that you choose to add in the settings. This is necessary to fetch the list of available applications.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Automatically Collected Information / Locally Stored Data:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Configuration File:</strong> The application stores your library URLs in a <code>config.json</code> file located in <code>%APPDATA%\TiwutLauncher</code>. This file is stored locally on your computer and is not transmitted to us.</li>
                    <li><strong>Icon Cache:</strong> To improve performance and reduce network requests, the application downloads and stores application icons in a local cache directory at <code>%APPDATA%\TiwutLauncher\icon_cache</code>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Installed Applications:</strong> Applications you choose to install are downloaded and stored in a folder within your <code>Documents</code> directory (<code>Documents\TiwutApps</code>). The application keeps track of these installed applications to populate the "My Library" section. This information remains on your local machine.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect any personally identifiable information (PII) such as your name, email address, or location. The application does not include any analytics or tracking functionality.</p>

            <li>Fetching lists of applications from the URLs you provide.</li>
            <li>Displaying application information, including names and icons.</li>
            <li>Downloading, installing, and managing the applications you select.</li>
            <li>Providing you with a view of your installed applications.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
        <p>We do not share any personal information with third parties, as we do not collect any.</p>
        <p>The application does interact with third-party servers at your direction:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>It sends requests to the library URLs you provide to fetch the application lists.</li>
            <li>It downloads application icons and installation files from the URLs specified in the library files.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We are not responsible for the privacy practices of the providers of these external libraries and applications. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of the libraries you add and the applications you install.</p>

        <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
        <p>All the information the Tiwut App Store manages, such as your configuration file, icon cache, and installed applications, is stored locally on your computer. We do not transmit this data to any central server. You are in full control of this data.</p>

        <h2>5. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
        <p>You have complete control over your data within the Tiwut App Store. You can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Access and Modify Your Library URLs:</strong> You can view, add, and remove library URLs at any time from the "Settings" page within the application.</li>
            <li><strong>Clear Your Cache:</strong> You can manually delete the contents of the <code>icon_cache</code> directory located at <code>%APPDATA%\TiwutLauncher\icon_cache</code> to clear all cached icons.</li>
            <li><strong>Uninstall Applications:</strong> You can uninstall applications through the application's user interface or by manually deleting the application's folder from your <code>Documents\TiwutApps</code> directory.</li>
            <li><strong>Remove All Application Data:</strong> To remove all data associated with the Tiwut App Store, you can delete the <code>%APPDATA%\TiwutLauncher</code> directory and the <code>Documents\TiwutApps</code> installation directory.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>The Tiwut App Store is not directed at children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from them.</p>

        <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the application or on our official website. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
